You are using the default legacy behaviour of the <class 'transformers.models.llama.tokenization_llama.LlamaTokenizer'>. This is expected, and simply means that the `legacy` (previous) behavior will be used so nothing changes for you. If you want to use the new behaviour, set `legacy=False`. This should only be set if you understand what it means, and thoroughly read the reason why this was added as explained in https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/24565

 I believe the meaning of life is to love. Love with everything you have and be willing to give it away freely, without expecting anything in return but maybe just a few smiles or warm fuzzy feelings from those around you who are touched by your giving heart…
When was last time when we gave something that mattered so much? It’s not

I am a big believer on connecting people together who share similar interests or experiences because

 I believe the meaning of life is to make a difference, and that all people are created equal. My goal in this class will be for us to figure out how we can help each other as well as our community change through action-oriented projects focused on social issues within ourselves or surrounding communities.
In order to understand what it means to have an impact

 I believe the meaning of life is to find and do your calling.
You are here because you want more than just a job, but rather an adventure into something bigger then yourself; not only for financial compensation or even self-fulfillment from work/life balance goals: To live with purpose while contributing in meaningful ways that make the world better!

 I believe the meaning of life is to find our passion, pursue it with everything we have and share that joy with others.
I am a writer/creator who believes in using my skills for good – empowering people through storytelling as well as bringing awareness towards issues that affect many communities around us; like mental health, social justice or the environment.
