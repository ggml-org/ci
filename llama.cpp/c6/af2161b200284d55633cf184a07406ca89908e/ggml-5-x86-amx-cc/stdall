I believe the meaning of life is to do the things we love, with the people we love, and the world we love.

I believe that our only fear is not knowing. And I believe that’s the fear that keeps us from doing the things that we know are good for us.

I believe that we have a choice.

I believe the meaning of life is to learn and grow in knowledge. And I believe that learning and growth is the key to happiness.

What would it mean to you to have a meaningful and happy life?

What would it mean to you to be happy in your own right and not be defined by what others think of you?

I believe the meaning of life is that which you believe you will find at the end of your life.

My life is very short. I do not expect that I will live forever. But I do hope I will have a long and happy life.

You have all made such a wonderful life together. I thank you for all you have
