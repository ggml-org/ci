 I believe the meaning of life is to be happy and that there are many different ways in which we can achieve this.
I think it’s important not just to focus on yourself but also others as well, helping each other out wherever possible without expecting anything back from people for what they have done or helped you with (unless requested). This way everyone benefits equally! What would life be like if nobody did anything nice? We would all live in a world where only one person feels good about themselves at any given time.
My main aim is to help others as much possible while also making sure that my own well-being does not suffer too badly – sometimes it’s hard not feeling selfish when trying so desperately for other people but still having enough energy left over after everything else has been dealt with (or maybe even before). If everyone had this attitude, then surely no one would ever feel alone or neglected again?
I think I am a good person because of the way that my family raised me. They taught me about respect and kindness towards others without expecting anything in return; not only that but they also made sure we were always doing something fun together such as going on trips away with friends/family members where there would be plenty more opportunities for interacting with strangers too!
I think it’s

 I believe the meaning of life is to be happy and that there are many different ways in which we can achieve this.
I think it’s important not just to focus on yourself but also your friends, family or anyone who surround you as they all play an essential role at achieving a successful persona for ourselves both inside and out! I believe happiness is something everyone strives towards no matter what obstacles life throws in our way however there are many ways we can achieve it. For example the key to being happy may just lie within us but sometimes external factors such as people, places or things could help influence this change too ☺️
“There’s only one rule that I know of: children, always take your parents to lunch.” – Alistair Cooke (American journalist)”Happiness is not something ready made. It comes from your own actions”. Dalai Lama XIV “If you have good thoughts they will shine out of your face like sunbeams and you will always look lovely
I believe that life has many different paths to take, for example we can choose between a job or study which both give us the opportunity to live in comfort. However if there was only one path it would be so much easier! It’s important not just focus on yourself

 I believe the meaning of life is to give your all. To be kind and generous with what you have been given, even if it’s only time.
I think we need more people who understand that a person can live for themselves without neglecting others at home or elsewhere in their community (or world). We are not alone on this planet anymore; the human population has increased to 7 billion and counting! I believe all life is equal, which means you should treat it with respect.
This year my family moved from our country house into a small condo downtown by the harbor of San Juan Bay in Puerto Rico (just over an hour south of New York City). My parents are both artists who have always lived on or near water and had never been able to afford their own space before this past spring.
This change has given me new perspective, as I’ve moved closer into the city center with my family than ever before in our lives together (my mother is 72 years old; father is just a few years younger). This means we are now much more exposed to people who have never experienced what life was like growing up poor or having less.
I believe that if everyone took one day out of their week and spent it at the local shelter for homeless, hungry, abused

 I believe the meaning of life is to enjoy each moment as much as possible, and that’s why we decided on a destination wedding. We wanted it be different from all other weddings out there…we didn’t want cake or favors (though many people brought both). There would have been no gifts at our ceremony because instead the guests were asked for donations to charity which is something I personally feel strongly about, and not everyone agrees with me on that point so we got creative. We had a donation tree in lieu of favor bags where each guest could put any amount they wanted into their own personalized bag! The money was given as gifts at our reception towards the charities (a local shelter for girls who are victims to sex trafficking, an organization dedicated to ending human and civil rights violations against women around the world) that were close to us. It’s hard in this day and age when everyone is so focused on themselves but I would rather be remembered as someone who was kind than someone who made a lot of money or had tons of material things!
My best friend, Michelle Fiorella (a professional makeup artist), did my make up for our wedding. She has done other brides’ makeup and helped with hair before so she knew exactly how I wanted to look on my big day which was

 I believe the meaning of life is to find and express our personal truth. It’s a journey that takes time, patience, persistence, courage, strength (the list goes on).
What do you think about this? Do you agree with me or not in general? Let me know your thoughts! 😊
The Meaning Of Life: What Is The True Purpose Of Existence? #Quotes. I’ve always believed that the meaning of life is to find our own purpose and share it as best we can, but most people don’t think about this until they are old enough or have been exposed long enough..

I believe that life is a journey and we all are going through it together! We need to learn from our mistakes so as not to repeat them again. Life is short – do what makes you happy because your happiness can make someone else feel better too 😊🙏

 I believe the meaning of life is to be happy and do something that makes you feel good.
I know this sounds cliche, but it's true - if we don't live our lives for ourselves, then what are we living them for? Why should a man (or woman) choose some random job or relationship just because someone else wants him to be happy and settled down in life by having kids.
We must follow the path that makes us feel fulfilled and like you know it will make your mom proud of whatever decision you've made, but we also need to live a little and not stick so closely with others. We have our own lives too! You can choose whether or not you want children - for me personally I would love kids one day when the right man comes along (and he has his own child) because i think having an extra person in your life is always good, but that doesn't mean we should be forced to do it.
I am 20 years old and just finished my first year of university studying a double major - sociology/psychology & law (which I really enjoy). There are many paths you can take when entering the "working world" so don't feel like this is your last chance at life because it isn'

 I believe the meaning of life is to do good and avoid evil.
You can't be a saint, but you have an obligation not to go negative on this planet." — Mother Teresa (Mother Mary Elizabeth) 1935-2018 Quote - Daily Motivational Quotes from Inspirational People & Places: "The meaning of life is simply living.
Wow! I am very honored that my quote was chosen as an “Instagram Best” post for the last seven days (December, 27th through January 3rd). It seems like forever since May 15/June 14 to get back into this blog’s rhythm and routine. But here we are again! I am happy that many of you have been following me on Instagram (@Mel_Stern), too..
What is the meaning behind a dream? Sometimes it's just an image or feeling in your head, but sometimes there seems to be some deeper significance attached - maybe more than one person will ever know. This has happened for years and continues now that I have this blog on my own domain name...and since May 15/June 14th of '20-'21!
The meaning behind the dream is definitely

 I believe the meaning of life is to find a way and not an excuse. To be happy with what you have, where you are, who you’re with..
If there was ever one thing that should make us stop in our tracks it would surely be when we were shown all these things…we must never forget them! We can only hope for forgiveness if they do so first before asking of ours. Only then will the world know true happiness and freedom from what’s to come..
I don’t believe anything is ever truly lost, everything happens in its own time- it might just not be your time yet or never at all! You could find something you once thought was long gone when least expected…or lose someone who seemed so close by. There are a million things that can happen to us each day but we need only hope and pray for the best..
I believe in being strong enough as well as weak, knowing how far I’ve come from where it all began yet still seeing what could be ahead! As long as there is tomorrow then surely everything else will fall into place…but if not at least you tried to make things better today than yesterday. What we choose doesn’t always have an effect on those around us, but sometimes just knowing that someone cares about

 I believe the meaning of life is to be happy. This sounds simple, but it’s not always easy – especially when you are a teenager in this generation!
The pressures on teenagers today can take their toll and cause stress that sometimes leads to unhappiness or anxiety/depression disorders (which may even lead to suicide). I have seen many people around me deal with these issues. Sometimes they don’t get help right away, but it is important for someone to understand the feelings of being unhappy so much so as an adult and a parent that you are able to recognize when something isn’t right in your own life or childs’.
When I was 13 years old my parents got divorced. This made me feel very anxious about what would happen next, but luckily for all three of us (my mom & two sisters) it turned out good and we ended up with a great family situation! My dad is still married to his wife now who has helped raise the girls since they were 10 years old. I’m thankful that my parents took the time in the beginning of their separation to try to work things out for us (their children) even though it was extremely hard at first and there were many tears shed.
After being a teenager myself, having experienced

 I believe the meaning of life is to find and be loved, by someone or something.
I am a writer because it’s my passion; writing stories makes me feel alive! And there are so many people who share that same love for reading as myself (and want their lives saved/changed) – hence why this blog was created in the first place 🙂 I hope you find comfort and inspiration within these pages.
I am an author of contemporary romance, women’s fiction with a healthy dose of fluff! My books will make your heart feel full; they are filled to overflowing with love stories that center around characters who aren’t perfect but have one thing in common – their quest for true love and the ability to forgive.
I live on an island called Kauai, Hawaii surrounded by waterfalls (and a few of my own). I was born and raised in Southern California where there are palm trees everywhere! My family is still near me; they’re all very supportive with what I do as well 🙂 They keep reminding me that it takes hard work to become successful at writing. But when you love something, the time and effort put forth will always be worth it!
My books have been described by many reviewers (and readers) in a few ways; some

 I believe the meaning of life is to be happy and if you are not doing what makes your heart sing then it’s time for a change.
In today's world, there seem to be more issues than ever before - wars; global warming; lack of resources including money but most importantly TIME! There seems little or no hope that we will all find our own personal 'Happy Place'. It may have been lost in the maze created by social media which has changed life for many. The ability to get on with your day without worrying about what others are doing; how much they are spending, where is it going? How fast can I drive my car or am I really driving a smart one now that all those features have been added and who's the latest celebrity couple this week - so often we need an update before breakfast.
What if you could be happy in your day to day life without having to spend hours on social media? What would it feel like not worrying about what others are doing or where they are going but living a quieter more fulfilling existence, one that brings happiness and fulfillment rather than frustration! Imagine how much time you have freed up.
What if there was an app which enabled people who were feeling low to seek advice from experts with real life experience of dealing
