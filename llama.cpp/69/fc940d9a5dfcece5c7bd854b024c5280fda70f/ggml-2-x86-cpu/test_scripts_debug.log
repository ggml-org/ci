I'm confused about the difference between a dependent variable and an independent variable.

**Dependent Variable:**

* A variable that is affected
>  by changes in other variables.
* It is the outcome or result of the experiment.
* It is typically measured after the independent variable has been manipulated.
> 

**Independent Variable:**

* A variable that is controlled or manipulated by the experimenter.
* It is the cause or factor that is believed to influence the
>  dependent variable.
* It is the variable that is changed or varied to observe its effect on the dependent variable.

**Example:**

* **Dependent Variable
> :** Student test score
* **Independent Variable:** Study hours

**In this example:**

* **Study hours** is the independent variable.
* **
> Student test score** is the dependent variable.

**Key Differences:**

* **Direction of Influence:**
    * Dependent variable: shows the effect of the
>  independent variable.
    * Independent variable: causes the dependent variable to change.
* **Measurement:**
    * Dependent variable: measured after the independent variable
>  is manipulated.
    * Independent variable: typically controlled or measured before the experiment.

**Summary:**

| Feature | Dependent Variable | Independent Variable |

> |---|---|---|
| Affect | Receives influence | Causes change |
| Outcome | Measured after manipulation | Controlled or varied |

> 

> 

> The provided text effectively
>  defines the differences between a dependent variable and an independent variable. It uses a clear and concise example to illustrate the concepts, making it easy for readers to understand.
> 

Here are some additional points that could be included to further enhance the understanding:

* **Example of a dependent variable that is affected by multiple independent variables:**
>  Student motivation, test anxiety, and study materials could all influence exam performance.
