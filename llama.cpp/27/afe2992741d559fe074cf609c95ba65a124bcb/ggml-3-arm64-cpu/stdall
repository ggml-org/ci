You are using the default legacy behaviour of the <class 'transformers.models.llama.tokenization_llama.LlamaTokenizer'>. This is expected, and simply means that the `legacy` (previous) behavior will be used so nothing changes for you. If you want to use the new behaviour, set `legacy=False`. This should only be set if you understand what it means, and thoroughly read the reason why this was added as explained in https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/24565

 I believe the meaning of life is to love. Love with everything you have and be willing to give it away freely, without expecting anything in return but maybe just a few smiles or warm fuzzy feelings from those around you who are touched by your giving heart…
When was last time when we gave something that mattered so much? It’s not

 I believe the meaning of life is to help people achieve happiness.
The purpose for my existence on earth, and why we are here at all really, can be summed up in two words: compassion & empathy.. We need only look around us from a perspective outside ourselves – as if observing someone else’s thoughts or feelings with the intent of understanding

 I believe the meaning of life is to make a difference, and that all people are created equal. My goal in this class will be for us to use our creativity as well as writing skills while applying what we learn about ourselves through these different exercises like poetry analysis (with your own poem) or journaling/writing prompts which I believe can really help

 I believe the meaning of life is to find and do your calling.
If you are not sure what that means, or if it’s a mythological concept (it isn't), read this short article from Seth Godin: What Does It Mean? You need an identity; we all do...and yours should be something more than just the
