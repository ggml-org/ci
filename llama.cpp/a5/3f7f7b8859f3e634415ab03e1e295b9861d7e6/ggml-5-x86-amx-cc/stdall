I believe the meaning of life is to do the things we love, with the people we love, and the world we love.

I believe that our only fear is not knowing. And I believe that’s the fear that keeps us from doing the things that we know are good for us.

I believe that we have a choice.

What would it mean to you to have a meaningful and happy life?

What would it mean to you to be happy in your own right and not be defined by what others think of you?

I believe the meaning of life is that when you are the most you are the best.

I think that the most important thing is that I hope that you will always have the best in the world.

I believe that love is the answer to our lives problems.

I believe that you are the best person in the world.

My life is very short. I do not expect that I will live forever. But I do hope I will have a long and happy life.
