I believe the meaning of life is that the whole of mankind is one mind, and that we are all one mind.

The meaning of life is, therefore, to live in the world, and to let men do what they do.

It is a sad reflection that the world is a sad place.

The meaning of life is

I believe the meaning of life is not found in a box on a shelf or a computer screen. It is found in the heart of a man who will not give up. It is found in a man who will not compromise. It is found in a man who will not surrender. It is found in the face of all of humanity.

I believe the meaning of life is a universal and self-evident truth. But I also believe that the truth is not the same for everyone. As we all know, there are differences between people, groups, and cultures. And so the truth itself is also an essential element of our diversity.

We are all the same, but we have
