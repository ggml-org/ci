 I believe the meaning of life is to love. Love unconditionally, without expectations and with a deep sense of gratitude for what you have been given on this day in your life; every single one that God has created so far!
To be able to walk down from childhood years into adulthood feeling complete contentment about yourself as well as the world

 I believe the meaning of life is to make a difference, and that all people are created equal. My goal in this class will be for us to connect with one another as we create our own path through literature by making connections between ourselves, other students reading alongside us (either online or face-to-face), and texts themselves.

 I believe the meaning of life is to find and follow your bliss.
So far, my most successful moments have been when it has come from deep in me: not trying so hard or thinking about what other people might think; being authentic with others who don't get it (yet). This doesn’t mean I haven’t had successes
