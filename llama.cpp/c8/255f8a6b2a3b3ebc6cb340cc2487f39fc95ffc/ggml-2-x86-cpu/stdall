You are using the default legacy behaviour of the <class 'transformers.models.llama.tokenization_llama.LlamaTokenizer'>. This is expected, and simply means that the `legacy` (previous) behavior will be used so nothing changes for you. If you want to use the new behaviour, set `legacy=False`. This should only be set if you understand what it means, and thoroughly read the reason why this was added as explained in https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/24565

 I believe the meaning of life is to make a difference, and that if you are not making any sort of impact on your community or world around it, then there’s no reason for being here in the first place.
I have been told this before, but at least today when someone said these words they were kinder than I was used to

 I believe the meaning of life is to find and do your calling.
You are here because you want more than just a job, but rather an adventure into something bigger: discovering yourself in this world where we can be our best selves while making connections with like-minded souls who share similar passions for what matters most – family, health & wellness

I’m here because you are looking for a way that allows both your mind AND body to feel good in your everyday world…a place where what you do isn’t limited by limitations YOU have created but instead opens up more possibilities than ever before! A space

 I believe the meaning of life is to make others happy and be a part of something bigger than yourself.
I am currently working on my senior year project in which we are asked what our final thesis will look like after graduation, or at least that was how it looked years ago when i had first heard about this topic... but now the question looks completely
