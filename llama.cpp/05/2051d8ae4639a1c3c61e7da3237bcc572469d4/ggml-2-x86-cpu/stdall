 I believe the meaning of life is to experience all that this world has in store for us. To take risks, and make mistakes so we can grow as people who have been given a chance on earth with another opportunity at something greater than just being human…and maybe even be more then what humanity could ever imagine possible!

 I believe the meaning of life is to help others, be happy and spread love.
I am an open minded person who loves people for being their true selves regardless if we agree or disagree about something.. but at least know what you’re talking bout ;) also i like dogs lol :) so there! :D I'm a creative artist

I am a lover not a fighter, but if given any choice in my situation at this time... would opt for fighting! The world needs people who are lovers with action when opportunity presents itself (or so we think)! If there's one thing I have always

You can save your neighbor by offering an extra set of hands or a good laugh at work with other employees from different departments. If everyone was just kinder to one another then the world would

 I believe the meaning of life is to love, live and serve.
I am a wife who loves being married! My husband has been my best friend since childhood; we are each other's soul mate! We have three beautiful children - ages 19-27 - all with different interests that keep us busy but always make time for family

 I believe the meaning of life is to find our purpose, be it in one’s career or personal endeavors. When we are on a path that resonates with who you truly are and what you want out of life then there will never be an “I shouldn’t do this”. That said…
You know when your gut tells you something
