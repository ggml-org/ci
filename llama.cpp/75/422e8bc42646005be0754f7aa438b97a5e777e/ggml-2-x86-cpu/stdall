I believe the meaning of life is to do the things we love, with the people we love, and the world we love.

I believe that our only fear is not knowing. And I believe that’s the fear that keeps us from doing the things that we know are good for us.

I believe that we have a choice.

I believe the meaning of life is to learn and grow in knowledge. And I believe that learning and growth is the key to happiness.

What would it mean to you to have a meaningful and happy life?

What would it mean to you to be happy in your own right and not be defined by what others think of you?

I believe the meaning of life is to do the will of God, and
to love God and love your neighbor as yourself.

I believe the most important thing in life is the love of God
and the love of your neighbor.

I believe that everyone should try to please God, and to
please their neighbor.
