I believe the meaning of life is to do the things we love, with the people we love, and the world we love.

I believe that our only fear is not knowing. And I believe that’s the fear that keeps us from doing the things that we know are good for us.

I believe that we have a choice.

I believe the meaning of life is to learn and grow in knowledge. And I believe that learning and growth is the key to happiness.

What would it mean to you to have a meaningful and happy life?

What would it mean to you to be happy in your own right and not be defined by what others think of you?

My life is very short. I do not expect that I will live forever. But I do hope I will have a long and happy life.

You have all made such a wonderful life together. I thank you for all you have
