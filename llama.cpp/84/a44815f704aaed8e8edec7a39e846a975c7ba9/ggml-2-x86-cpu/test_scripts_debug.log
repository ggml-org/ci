**Limitations:**

* I am not able to access real-time information or perform physical tasks
* My knowledge is based on the data
>  I was trained on, and I may not have access to up-to-date information
* I can sometimes make factual errors

**How I can assist
> :**

* Provide information on a specific topic
* Generate summaries of articles or documents
* Answer questions about a wide range of subjects
* Assist with brainstorming
>  and idea generation
* Provide creative writing and storytelling assistance

**Additional Features:**

* Personalized user experience
* Continuous learning and improvement
* Multilingual support
> 

**Examples of my capabilities:**

* "What is the history of quantum computing?"
* "Summarize the main points of this article."
*
>  "Can you help me create a marketing plan?"
* "Generate a story about a superhero."
* "What are some ideas for a new product?"
