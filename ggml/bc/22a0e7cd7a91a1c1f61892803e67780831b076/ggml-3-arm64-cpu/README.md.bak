I believe the meaning of life is not to be confused with its purpose. In a way, the term "living" is also used to describe a living organism. The term "living" is applied to a living organism which is in its infancy, or at least, has not yet reached maturity. The term "living organism" refers to a living

I believe the meaning of life is to live to the fullest extent possible.

If we have given up our own personal life and are willing to accept that we have failed in the way of love, then there will be no loss, no sorrow, no suffering.
