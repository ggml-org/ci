I believe the meaning of life is not to be confused with life. It is to be understood as a system of thought. It is to be understood as the "truth." And if there is not a system of thought, then there is not a whole system of thought. There is only the totality of one consciousness, and that is the totality of

HuffPost: Is it possible that this was a message that the world had to learn from, that we need to learn from all of these people that live for so long and can

sequence 6:

I believe the meaning of life is to live without fear, so that you may be free from all thoughts, fears, thoughts, and passions. This is an essential principle of the Buddhist philosophy." In the early 19th century, an English psychiatrist named Edward S. Wightman proposed that life was a necessary condition for the survival of all beings,

sequence 7:

I believe the meaning of life is a gift for life." In a recent interview with The New York Times, I spoke to the author of a book on the subject, Michael Fassbender, about his belief in a "transcendental life." He said he was intrigued by his sense of meaning: "It is a very, very real possibility
